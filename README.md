# DataAccessCodeGenerator
This library was written in 2004 around the time where there were really no good ORM's available at the time - at least none that really fit my needs so this library is a code generation tool that when pointed at a database will create the DTO's DAO's, DataLayer, and BusinessLayer classes that can be extended since they are virtual.
